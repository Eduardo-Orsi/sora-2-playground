## ‚ú® Features

*   **üé¨ Video Creation Mode:** Generate new videos from text prompts using Sora 2 or Sora 2 Pro.
*   **üé® Video Remix Mode:** Make targeted changes to existing videos with new prompts.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Full API Parameter Control:** Access and adjust all relevant parameters supported by the Sora 2 API directly through the UI (model selection, resolution, duration, optional input reference for first frame).
*   **üîÑ Multi-Video Queuing:** Queue multiple videos for generation simultaneously - create as many videos as you want while others are processing.
*   **üîÄ Two deployment modes:** backend (server API key) or frontend-only (user-supplied keys)

*   **üìú Detailed History & Cost Tracking:**
    *   View a comprehensive history of all your video generations and remixes.
    *   See the parameters used for each request (model, resolution, duration, prompt).
    *   Get detailed cost breakdowns (`$USD`) for each video. (hint: click the `$` amount on the video)
    *   Real-time progress tracking for videos currently being generated.
    *   Click any prompt to copy the full text.
    *   View total historical API cost.
    *   Delete individual videos from history (removes from local storage and OpenAI servers).
    *   Failed requests are tracked separately with error messages and excluded from cost calculations.

*   **üì• Video Download:** Download generated videos directly to your device.
*   **üíæ Storage:** Controlled by `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE`:
    *   **R2 (default):** Completed assets are uploaded to Cloudflare R2 and metadata is persisted in Postgres.
    *   **Filesystem:** Videos saved to `./generated-videos` on the server (includes video, thumbnail, and spritesheet).
    *   **IndexedDB:** Videos saved directly in the browser (ideal for frontend-only builds).
    *   Active job IDs are persisted so queued renders resume polling after refresh.

## üîÄ Deployment Modes

This playground supports two deployment architectures depending on your needs:

| Feature | Backend Mode | Frontend Mode |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **OpenAI API Key Location** | Server-side (single shared key) | Client-side (user-supplied) |
| **Password Protection** | ‚úÖ Supported via `APP_PASSWORD` | ‚ùå Not supported |
| **Storage** | Cloudflare R2 (default) or local disk | IndexedDB only |
| **Build Output** | Dynamic (includes API routes) | Static HTML/CSS/JS export |
| **User Setup** | None (admin configures) | Each user provides their own API key |

**Backend Mode** is the default, ideal for personal use or team deployments where you control the API key.

**Frontend Mode** creates a static site that runs entirely in the browser, perfect for public deployments where each user brings their own API key.

## üöÄ Getting Started [Local Deployment]

Follow these steps to get the playground running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 20 or later required)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### 1. Set Up API Key üü¢

You need an OpenAI API key to use this application.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your OpenAI Organization needs access to Sora 2 API** - This is currently in limited beta. Check [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs) for availability.

**Quick start:** Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the values, or create a new `.env.local` file manually.

1.  If you don't have a `.env.local` file, create one (or rename `.env.local.example`).
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file:

    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

    **Important:** Keep your API key secret. The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` by default to prevent accidental commits.

<br/>

#### Password Protection

Add password authentication to protect your local deployment:

```dotenv
APP_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

When `APP_PASSWORD` is set, the application will prompt for authentication on page load. This prevents unauthorized access to your deployment.

  <img src="./readme-images/password-dialog.png" alt="Password Dialog" width="460"/>
  <br/>

</p>

#### Postgres + Cloudflare R2 (backend storage)

Backend mode now writes history to Postgres and stores completed assets in Cloudflare R2. Set the following variables:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket
R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<bucket>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=r2
```

After updating `.env.local`, run:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This bootstraps the `video_history` table so new jobs can be recorded.

#### Frontend-only Mode (Static)

Want to run everything purely in the browser and let each user supply their own API key? Enable frontend mode:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FRONTEND_MODE=true
```

- The UI switches to frontend mode and stores videos in IndexedDB automatically.
- The app password flow is disabled (there‚Äôs no secure way to enforce it client-side).
- Build the static site with:

  ```bash
  pnpm build:frontend
  ```

  This generates an `out/` directory that you can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, etc.
- Users will be prompted for their own OpenAI API key inside the browser‚Äîno server-side key required.

---

#### File Storage Mode

Configure where generated videos are stored:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=r2  # or fs/indexeddb
```

**Defaults:**
- **Local deployments:** `r2` (Cloudflare R2) when credentials are present, otherwise `fs`.
- **Vercel deployments:** `indexeddb` (browser storage) unless the required R2 credentials are set.

**Available modes:**
- **`r2` (Cloudflare R2):** Videos are proxied through the backend, uploaded to your configured bucket, and referenced from Postgres.
- **`fs` (filesystem):** Videos saved to the server's `./generated-videos` directory. Only works for local deployments or hosting with persistent filesystem.
- **`indexeddb` (browser storage):** Videos downloaded from OpenAI and stored in the browser's IndexedDB. Ideal for serverless/ephemeral environments.

**Important:** If you explicitly set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=fs` on Vercel, it will be automatically overridden to `indexeddb` to prevent errors (Vercel's filesystem is read-only/ephemeral).

For local development, you can use either mode. If not set, the application auto-detects the environment.

---

#### Custom API Endpoint

If you need to use an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (e.g., a local model server or a different provider), you can specify its base URL using the `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env.local` file:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=your_compatible_api_endpoint_here
```

If `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` is not set, the application will default to the standard OpenAI API endpoint.

### 2. Install Dependencies üü¢

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
# or
# pnpm install
# or
# bun install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server üü¢

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm dev
# or
# bun dev
```

### 4. Open the Playground üü¢

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. You should now be able to use the Sora 2 Playground!

### üì¶ Building a Static Frontend Bundle

If you enabled `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FRONTEND_MODE`, produce a static export that you can host anywhere (S3, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.):

```bash
pnpm build:frontend
```

The compiled site will be available in the `out/` directory.

## ‚ñ≤ Deploy to Vercel

Choose the deployment flavour that fits your use case:

#### Backend Mode (server-side API key)

[![Deploy backend mode](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/alasano/sora-2-playground&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,APP_PASSWORD&envDescription=OPENAI_API_KEY%20required.%20APP_PASSWORD%20required%20during%20setup%20(protects%20public%20deployment%2C%20removable%20in%20settings%20afterward).&project-name=sora-2-playground&repository-name=sora-2-playground)

Store the OpenAI API key on the server and gate access with an optional password. (On Vercel the filesystem remains ephemeral, so videos still land in browser storage.)

#### Frontend-only Mode (static, user-supplied key)

[![Deploy frontend mode](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/alasano/sora-2-playground&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FRONTEND_MODE&envDescription=Set%20NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FRONTEND_MODE%20to%20true%20so%20users%20provide%20their%20own%20OpenAI%20API%20key%20in%20browser.&project-name=sora-2-playground-frontend&repository-name=sora-2-playground-frontend)

Runs entirely in the browser. Each visitor pastes their own OpenAI API key, everything is stored in IndexedDB, and the build can be hosted as static assets.

### What Happens When You Deploy:

1. **Vercel clones this repository** to your GitHub account (creates a private repo by default)
2. **Deploys from the `master` branch** to a production URL
3. **You'll be prompted to enter** environment variables during setup
4. **Your deployment goes live** immediately after setup completes

### üîí Important Security Note:

**Production URLs on Vercel are public.** In backend mode an `APP_PASSWORD` is strongly recommended so random visitors can‚Äôt spend your API credits. Frontend mode doesn‚Äôt need (or support) password protection because the browser build can‚Äôt secure it.

### Environment Variables

**Backend mode** button prompts for:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` *(required)* ‚Äì stored server-side and used for all video operations.
- `APP_PASSWORD` *(required during setup)* ‚Äì adds a password prompt to the UI. Remove it later in Vercel settings if you want the site open.
- `DATABASE_URL` *(required)* ‚Äì Postgres connection string for persisting job history.
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` ‚Äì credentials for Cloudflare R2 uploads.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE` ‚Äì set to `r2` when using the shared storage backend.

**Frontend mode** button prompts for:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FRONTEND_MODE` ‚Äì set this to `true` during setup. No server-side API key is needed; users paste their own key in the browser.
- (Optional) you can also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=indexeddb`, but the app forces IndexedDB automatically when frontend mode is enabled.

### üîê Advanced: Protected Preview Deployments

If you want your deployment protected by Vercel team authentication instead of being publicly accessible:

1. **Create a new branch** in your GitHub repo (e.g., `production`):
   - Via GitHub UI: Branches ‚Üí New branch
   - Or locally: `git checkout -b production && git push -u origin production`
2. **Go to Vercel:** Project Settings ‚Üí Git ‚Üí Production Branch
3. **Change** from `master` to `production`
4. **Result:**
   - Deployments from `master` branch ‚Üí Preview deployments (requires Vercel login to access)
   - Deployments from `production` branch ‚Üí Public production deployments

### Post-Deployment:

- With `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=r2`, completed videos are saved to your R2 bucket and served via the URLs stored in Postgres. Otherwise the app falls back to browser IndexedDB.
- Frontend mode prompts each visitor for their OpenAI API key; backend mode uses the server key you set during deployment.
- You can add, modify, or remove environment variables anytime in Vercel Project Settings.
- You can add a custom domain in Vercel Project Settings ‚Üí Domains.
